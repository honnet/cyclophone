Welcome to the cyclophone project !
===================================

This art project is designed with several interactive components, a description is made here:
http://www.maisonpop.net/spip.php?article1484

This repository contains the code for a (Teensy) Arduino to send MIDI signals (for sounds and video) depending on the speed of 2 bikes.
The speed is estimated thanks to a dynamo connected to a diode bridge (because of the AC signal) and voltage divider (because we have a maximum of 25V and we want 5V).

Checkout the video of the installation:

Enjoy !
Jimmy & Drix, with the video master Hélène Ruiz and the cyclophone master Santiago Guerrero.
